function [logfn]=logfactorial(n)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This function evaluates the logarithm of n! with absolute accuracy of 1e-12 or better, and
% relative accuracy of 1e-15 or better. The following codes employ Stirling's integration 
% formula of Gamma function.
% Input parameters:
% n - the positive integer to be evaluated;
% Output parameters:
% logfn - the logrithm value of n!
% Note: 
%(1)if n<171, the value of log(n!) can be computed with high accuracy by Matlab itself;
%(2) n doesn't have to be an integer.
